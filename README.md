# InSpec: Inspect Your Infrastructure

InSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human- and machine-readable language for specifying compliance, security and policy requirements.

```ruby
# Disallow insecure protocols by testing

describe package('telnetd') do
Â  it { should_not be_installed }
end

describe inetd_conf do
Â  its("telnet") { should eq nil }
end
```
InSpec makes it easy to run your tests wherever you need. More options are found in our [CLI docs](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/).
